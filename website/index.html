        <h1>Come get naked in the desert.</h1>
        <p>Juniper Camp is a naturist group that enjoys going to hot springs, climbing mountains, having barbecues, and anything else that sounds fun in the buff.</p>
        <p>We're based in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>
        <h1>What's a "naturist" group?</h1>
        <p>Glad you asked. Read this first: <a href="https://naturism.is">naturism.is</a>. Now that you've got an idea of what it is, our group specifically focuses on social, family, outdoor naturism.</p>
        <h1>Who are you?</h1>
        <p>My name is <a href="https://body.social/@trey">Trey</a>. My partner is <a href="https://body.social/@kristina">Kristina</a>. We have a energetic baby girl named Liza.</p>
        <h1>Want to join?</h1>
        <div class="joiner">
          <input type="email" placeholder="you@youremail.com">
          <input type="submit" value="Get in touch">
        </div>
        <h1>In our free time</h1>
        <p>We don't just organize groups. We're also software engineers that write code for naturism.</p>
        <p>One of our projects right now is a Mastodon social network named <a href="https://body.social">body.social</a>. In fact, that's where we do all of our event organization.</p>
        <p>We also made that nifty site called <a href="https://naturism.is">naturism.is</a></p>
        <p>All of these projects are open source and available to <a href="https://github.com/JuniperCamp">browse</a> at your leisure... because that's what you do in your free time, right? Read code?</p>
